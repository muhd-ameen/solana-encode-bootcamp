### Create a keypair
mkdir ~/my-solana-wallet solana-keygen new --outfile ~/my-solana-wallet/my-keypair.json

display the result with solana-keygen pubkey ~/my-solana-wallet/my-keypair.json

verify your address solana-keygen verify <PUBKEY> ~/my-solana-wallet/my-keypair.json

### Connect to the dev network
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com You can check the configuration with solana config get

Get some tokens from dev net solana airdrop 1 <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

A bash profile has been created for these commands, probably quite trivial to use.
Below are the how to instructinos:


#### init the profile in the bash terminal
`source ~/.bash_profile`

#### Create a keypair and store the public key
`create_solana_keypair`

#### Display the public key
`display_solana_pubkey`

#### Verify the address
`verify_solana_address`

#### Connect to the dev network
`connect_solana_devnet`

#### Get some tokens from dev net (replace <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> with the actual address)
`airdrop_solana_tokens <RECIPIENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`
